# Introducing the xi-iot Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Note**: Nutanix is actively developing the xi-iot CLI. As a result, the software published here is release candidate (RC) quality until further notice. 
Use this software at your own risk and do not use it in a production environment or deployment. The latest release candidate is shown below.

The xi-iot CLI is a command line tool that helps you manage your Karbon Services for IoT resources from your terminal or shell. With minimal 
configuration, you can start using Karbon Services for IoT functionality equal to that provided by the browser-based Karbon Services for IoT Management 
Console from the command prompt in your favorite terminal program.

## Shell Support
**Linux and macOS** You can use common shell programs such as bash and zsh.
Note that autocompletion for zsh is experimental in this release.

# Configuring xi-iot CLI
Configure the xi-iot CLI to interact with Karbon Services for IoT API, including your user role and credentials.
A xi-iot CLI user operates under a specific context. A user email address, password, and context name defines the context.
The user operates according to the role assigned to their user name and email for Karbon Services for IoT users. 

For example, create a context named local_user_ctx_1 for an existing local user user1@contoso.com with a password of nutanix/4u.
(A local user is a user that does not have My Nutanix portal credentials.) 

**Note**: You can only specify an existing local user email name and password in this example. 
If you do not have a local user, create one according to the [Creating a User topic](https://portal.nutanix.com/#/page/docs/details?targetId=Xi-IoT-Infra-Admin-Guide:edg-iot-add-users-t.html) at the Nutanix Support Portal.

```
xi-iot config create-context local_user_ctx_1 --email user1@contoso.com --password nutanix/4u
```


# Autocompletion for bash/zsh
The xi-iot CLI supports autocompletion with bash on MacOS and Linux. Using this command for zsh is experimental and not formally supported.
To configure auto-completion for your favorite shell, run this command and follow the instructions.
```
xi-iot completion --help
```

# Using samples
Under `samples/` directory, there are samples for various Karbon Services for IoT entities including Data Sources, Data Pipelines, Applications, etc. These samples can be used as a reference when creating your own Karbon Services for IoT entities. Each entity has a README which explains the details of each individual attribute of that entity.
