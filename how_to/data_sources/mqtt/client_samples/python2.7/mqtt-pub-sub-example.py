# Example code to connect, publish and subscribe from a mqtt client
# For the example to work:
# 1. create a dir named 'certs' under $PWD and copy the certs
#    generated using Karbon Services for IoT SaaS Portal.
# 2. Modify the 'broker_address' variable to point to the edge
#    ip address that is being used for the tests.
