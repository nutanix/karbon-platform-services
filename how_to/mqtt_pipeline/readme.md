# XI IOT - QUICK START FOR MQTT DATA PIPELINES

## Xi IoT Overview

The Nutanix Xi IoT platform delivers local compute and AI for IoT edge devices, converging the edge and cloud into one seamless data processing platform. The Xi IoT platform eliminates complexity, accelerates deployments, and elevates developers to focus on the business logic powering IoT applications and services. Now developers can use a low-code development platform to create application software via APIs instead of arduous programming methods.

#### Creating a Project

In Xi IoT, Projects are used to segment resources such as applications and edges so that only assigned users can view and modify them. This allows different departments or teams to utilize shared data sources, edges, or cloud resources without interfering with each other.

As part of this tutorial, you’ll create a new Project to deploy your sample Data Pipelines and Applications.
1. From the **Xi IoT** management portal, select **More > Projects > + Create**.
1. Fill out the following fields and click **Next**:
