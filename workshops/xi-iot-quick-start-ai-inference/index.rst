   .. note::
   
      The pipeline's input data source is selected using a category named *youtube-8m* with a value of *channel1*. Like all Karbon Services for IoT data pipeline inputs, 
      YouTube-8M data sources are selected dynamically using categories. This dynamic nature makes adding and changing data sources at scale much easier than 
      if they were static. It also means that data sources can be easily changed without changes to transformation code.

   .. figure:: contents/images/image7.png

      Figure 3: Data Pipeline: Input by channel1 category

   .. note::
      
         The pipeline executes a transformation function named **objdetect_func-python**. This is a sample python function that uses a `Tensorflow based 
         ssd mobilenet v2 model trained on the COCO dataset <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md>`__
         embedded in the Karbon Services for IoT Tensorflow Python runtime.

#. Click :fa:`remove` to close the data pipeline without making any changes.

In Karbon Services for IoT, categories help you assign various attributes to edges and data sources which can be further used to query and select them when creating Data Pipelines or deploying Applications.

An example of a category could be “City” with values in [San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego] or “State” with values in [California, Washington, Oregon] and so on. It can be anything meaningful to your environment. 

In the next steps, you'll add a new category for assignment to a new YouTube-8M channel, add the channel to the YouTube-8M data source, and modify
the data pipeline to use this new channel.

#. Click :fa:`bars` **> Administration > Categories**.

#. Click the :fa:`check` box beside the youtube-8m Category, then click **Edit**.

#. Click :fa:`plus` **Add Value**, enter **channel2**, click the round, blue :fa:`check`, then click **Update**.

#. Click :fa:`bars` **> Infrastructure > Data Sources**.

#. Click the :fa:`check` box beside the youtube-8m data source, then click **Edit**.

#. Click **Add New URL**, enter **youtube-8m-2** in the Name field, copy and paste **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYbrTRE1bZg** into the URL field, click the round, blue :fa:`check`, then click **Next**. 

   The URL Extraction page should look like the figure below.

   .. figure:: contents/images/image8.png

         Figure 4: Two YouTube-8M URLs

#. On the Category Assignment page, click inside the **Select Fields dropdown** and choose **Select Fields...**.

Using the Karbon Services for IoT AI Inferencing Service to Detect Objects
#########################################################

About this task

Use data pipelines and a YouTube-8M video to demonstrate object detection using the Karbon Services for IoT AI Inferencing Service.

#. If you are not logged on, open https://iot.nutanix.com/ in a web
   browser and log in.

#. Click :fa:`bars` **> Apps and Data > Data Pipelines**.

#. On the ai-inference-service-demo data pipeline tile, click **Actions**, then **Edit**.

   This data pipeline will look very similar to the youtube-8m-object-detection pipeline used in the earlier exercise. However, there's one major difference.
   Take notice of the transformation function used in this pipeline. It's named **ml_objectdetect_func-python**.

   To better understand how the AI Inferencing Service works, first take a look at the **objdetect_func-python** used in
   the youtube-8m-object-detection data pipeline in the earlier exercise, then compare it to the **ml_objectdetect_func-python** function.

#. Click :fa:`remove` to close the data pipeline without making any changes.

#. Click :fa:`bars` **> Apps and Data > Functions**.

#. Click the :fa:`check` box beside the **objdetect_func-python** function, then click **Edit**.

   Notice that the function is written in python and uses the Karbon Services for IoT Tensorflow Python runtime.

#. Click **Next**.

   The function's python code is now displayed. Take notice of lines 16-19 excerpted below:

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:
      :lineno-start: 16
   
      BASE_PATH = "/mllib/objectdetection"

      # ssd_inception_v2_coco	latency - 42ms
      PATH_TO_CKPT = BASE_PATH + '/ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17/frozen_inference_graph.pb'

   As mentioned in the earlier exercise, the ssd inception v2 model is embedded in the Karbon Services for IoT Tensorflow Python runtime. This is
   fine for an example, but not suitable for production deployments. For example, the model cannot be updated.

   Now compare this python code to that used in the ml_objectdetect_func-python function used in the ai-inference-service-demo data pipeline.

#. Click :fa:`remove` to close the function without making any changes.

#. Uncheck the :fa:`check` box beside the **objdetect_func-python** function, click the :fa:`check` box beside the **ml_objdetect_func-python** function, then click **Edit**.

   Notice that this function is also written in python and uses the Karbon Services for IoT Tensorflow Python runtime.

#. Click **Next**.

   The function's python code is now displayed. This time, first take notice of line 23:

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:
      :lineno-start: 23
   
      ai_inference_endpoint = os.environ['AI_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT']

   Object detection, or inference, will now be performed by the Inferencing Service, so the function must know the service 
   endpoint for submission at the edge. As you can see, its automatically passed to the runtime as an environment variable.

   Now take notice of lines 153-170 excerpted below:

   .. code-block:: python
      :linenos:
      :lineno-start: 153
   
      def detect(image):
         image_np = np.asarray(image, dtype="int32")
         image_np_expanded = np.expand_dims(image_np, axis=0)
         data = json.dumps({"signature_name": "serving_default",
                           "instances": image_np_expanded.tolist()})
         headers = {"content-type": "application/json"}
         model_name = "objectdetect"
         model_version = 1
         url = "http://%s/v1/models/%s/versions/%d:infer" % (
            ai_inference_endpoint, model_name, model_version)
         response = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers)
         if response.status_code != 200:
            logging.error(response.json())
            return None
         text = response.text
         inference_payload = json.loads(text)
         predictions = inference_payload['predictions']
         return predictions[0]

   This excerpt is of the detect function utilizing the Inferencing Service. Of particular note are
   lines 159-161 where the model_name is set to objectdetect, model_version is set to 1, and the connection
   url is built with the ai_inference_endpoint (remember this was passed automatically).

   For this example, the Inferencing Service has already been pre-loaded with the same ssd inception v2
   model, but this time trained using the `Open Images dataset <https://github.com/openimages/dataset>`__.

#. Click :fa:`remove` to close the function without making any changes.

#. View how this model and others can be managed by clicking :fa:`bars` **> Apps and Data > ML Models**.

#. Click the :fa:`check` box beside the **objectdetect** model, then click **Edit**.

   Example model version 1 is listed along with the Tensorflow Framework Type. A new version of the model
   could be uploaded by clicking :fa:`plus` **Add new**. This version could then be referenced in functions
   similarly to line 160 in the example code above.

   .. note::
   
      One additional benefit of using the Karbon Services for IoT Inferencing Service is that multiple functions and pipelines
      can share edge hardware resources, such as GPUs, when running machine inference. 

#. Click :fa:`remove` to close the ML model without making any changes.
 
If you'd like to view the data pipeline and Inferencing Service in action, simply navigate back to the 
**ai-inference-service-demo** data pipeline tile, start the pipeline, then click to view the Http Live Stream.
