# Deploy a Kubernetes Application on Karbon Platform Services

Karbon Platform Services (KPS) is a Kubernetes based multi-cloud PaaS that enables rapid development and deployment of microservices-based applications ranging from simple stateful containerized applications to complex AI, IoT and hybrid applications across any cloud.

This tutorial will guide you through the deployment and update of a sample Kubernetes Application using KPS. The application is deployed to a KPS Service Domain for execution. This tutorial assumes your Service Domain has already been deployed using steps from the <a href="https://portal.nutanix.com/page/documents/details?targetId=Karbon-Platform-Services-Admin-Guide:ks-service-domain-manage-c.html">Karbon Platform Services Admin Guide</a> and that direct network connectivity between the Service Domain and your workstation is configured (to view sample web app output). Access to the Admin Guide is provided via the My Nutanix Portal and requires an account to login.

**For brevity, several component applications in this tutorial have been combined into single deployment manifests (Kubernetes YAML or Helm chart). This is not representative of a typical production deployment, where all applications and services are deployed as separate apps using API calls in a standard CI/CD pipeline.** 

## Accessing Karbon Platform Services
1. Open https://my.nutanix.com/ in your browser. If you don't already have a My Nutanix account, follow steps to create one.
1. Scroll to the Cloud Services section and click Launch to access the Karbon Platform Services Cloud Management Console.

   At this point you should have a dashboard with a default User (you), Project, Category.

## Application Design
The application deployed as part of this tutorial is a typical content management system where users can post blogs, articles and others can add comments to it. You will also add analytics like a wordcloud to tell authors the most popular terms in the reviews for their posts. 

Here are the components used to build the application:

* Wordpress as the content management engine for creating the e-commerce application
* MySQL database to support Wordpress
* Debezium for getting change events from DB to Kafka
* Kafka for streaming the orders other services like Recommendation Service
* Recommendation Service receives the streams and updates the most bought product listing page
* Loader which will simulate user behavior with artificially created data about products and pruchase history

## Application Architecture

## Application Deployment

The following steps will explain how to deploy the Woodkraft application on KPS. 

### Creating a Project
In KPS, Projects are used to segment resources such as Kubernetes Apps and other services so that only assigned users can view and modify them. This allows different departments or teams to utilize shared Service Domains, or cloud resources without interfering with each other's applications or business logic.

As part of this tutorial, youâ€™ll create a new Project to deploy your sample Application.

1. After logging into the Karbon Platform Services Cloud Management Console, proceed to the Projects section. 
1. Create a project, name it Woodkraft Application, add yourself as a User, and then click **Next**. 

   ![App Setup!](img/app-setup.png "App Setup")

1. On the Resources Assignment dialog, select the Service Domain you wish to run your application and click **Next**. 
   
   KPS has the ability to natively send to several public cloud services such as AWS S3, or GCP Cloud Datastore. For this tutorial, Cloud Profile Selection can be left blank because no cloud resources will be used.

   KPS can run Kubernetes Apps with images stored in public or private registries. Private registries can be accessed by creating a KPS Container Registry Profile to store required access information. Because this tutorial utilizes containers hosted in a public registry, Container Registry Selection can be left blank.
 
1. In the final section, enable **Kafka**, **Prometheus**, **Traefik**, and **Istio** services and click **Create**.

### Application Helm Chart

In this section, you will be uploading a Helm chart that will deploy microservices necessary for the application such as Wordpress, Debezium, Prometheus, and MySQL. Prometheus will be used for event monitoring and alerting for the application. The purpose of the other apps are described above.

1. In a new browser tab or window, download the compressed tar file labeled <a href="woodkraft-apps.tgz" download>woodkraft-apps</a>. This file contains Helm charts for deploying the first set of Kubernetes Apps. 
1. Switch context to Woodkraft Application in the Project pulldown, then click **Kubernetes Apps**. 
1. Create a new Kubernetes App and name it __woodkraft-apps__. In the Service Domain Selection section, be sure to choose the same Service Domain you selected for the project, then click **Next**. 

   ![Helm Chart1!](img/helm-chart1.png "Helm Chart1")

1. On the Configuration dialog, upload the woodkraft-apps tar file downloaded earlier as a Helm chart. Select **Show YAML** for a look at the sample configurations, then click **Create**. This Helm chart will deploy major app services such as Wordpress, Debezium, Prometheus, and MySQL.

#### Verify Istio, Kafka and Traefik configurations

1. Browse to the Istio section in the UI and confirm new Application Metrics for woodkraft-apps are now present.

   ![Init-Istio!](img/init-istio-config.png "Application Metrics")

1. Browse to the Kafka section in the UI and confrim new wordpress_db topics have been created.

   ![kafka-topics!](img/kafka-topics.png "Kafka Topics")
   
1. Browse to the Traefik section in the UI to confirm new ingress rules for woodkraft-apps were created.

   ![Traefik2!](img/init-traefik.png "Traefik Rules")

### Monitor Helm Chart

Uploading the next Helm chart will deploy monitoring services such as Grafana and will make edits to the Traefik Rules. Grafana provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. It is expandable through a plug-in system. End users can create complex monitoring dashboards using interactive query builders. Traefik ingress allows for content-based routing, load balancing, and SSL/TLS termination.

1. Download the compressed tar file labeled <a href="woodkraft-monitoring.tgz" download>woodkraft-monitoring</a>. 
	* This file contains Helm charts for deploying the Kubernetes Apps for monitoring the core apps deployed above.
1. Once again, click **Kubernetes Apps** in context of the Woodkraft Application project. 
1. Create a new Kubernetes App and name it __woodkraft-monitoring__. 
1. Choose the same service domain you selected for the project, then click **Next**. 
1. On the Configuration dialog, upload the monitoring tar file as a Helm chart, and click **Create**. 
	* This Helm chart will deploy a new Grafana app on the Service Domain.
1. Browse to the Traefik section in the UI to confirm new ingress rule for Grafana was created.

The application has now been deployed and should be running successfully on your Service Domain.

### Accessing the Applications

1. Create two new DNS records that map the hostnames and IP addresses used in the **woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com** and **grafana.woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com** Traefik rules created above. For simplicity, on your local workstation, add the hostnames to the **/etc/hosts** file.

#### MacOS/Linux
```
echo "<Node IP> woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "<Node IP> grafana.woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

#### Windows
```
echo <Node IP> woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com >> %WINDIR%\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts
echo <Node IP> grafana.woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com >> %WINDIR%\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts
```

#### WordPress

Visit [woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com](https://woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com/) and confirm that the application is working successfully. 

![App Web Page](img/app.png "web page")

#### Grafana

1. Visit [grafana.woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com](https://grafana.woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com/).
1. Enter *admin* for both the username and password.
1. Enter the password of your choosing.
	* This will be the password for future logins with the *admin* username
1. View the Grafana dashboard linked to the Woodkraft application.

### Smart Update Helm Chart

The final Helm chart will push updates to the already deployed application. The update deploys an additinal recommendation service and modifies the Istio Virtual Service configuration for the recommendation service currently running in the app. Connections from Firefox browsers will now be directed to recommendation service v2. In KPS, Istio provides traffic management, secure connection, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection.

1. Download the compressed tar file labeled <a href="woodkraft-smart-update.tgz" download>woodkraft-smart-update</a>.
1. Once again, click **Kubernetes Apps** in context of the Woodkraft Application project. 
1. Create a new Kubernetes app and name it __woodkraft-updates__. Again, be sure to choose the same service domain you selected for the project, then click **Next**.
1. On the Configuration dialog, upload the smart-update tar file as a Helm chart, and click **Create**. 
	* This Helm chart will update the recommendation service running in the application. 
1. Browse to the Istio, Virtual Services section in the UI and confirm and confirm there are two recommendation services running.
	* Notice the regex labeled *Firefox*
1. Open [woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com](https://woodkraft.karbon.nutanix.com/recommendations) in Firefox and view the updated recommendation service.
