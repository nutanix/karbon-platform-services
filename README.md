## Karbon Services for IoT Overview
The Nutanix Karbon Services for IoT platform delivers local compute and AI for IoT edge devices, converging the edge and cloud into one seamless data processing platform. The Karbon Services for IoT platform eliminates complexity, accelerates deployments, and elevates developers to focus on the business logic powering IoT applications and services. Now developers can use a low-code development platform to create application software via APIs instead of arduous programming methods.

## Karbon Services for IoT Trial
This Karbon Services for IoT Quick Start leverages the Karbon Services for IoT Trial. The trial is a limited-time, ready-to-deploy implementation of the Karbon Services for IoT edge computing platform. The Karbon Services for IoT Trial provides pre-built applications and data connectors hosted on its own infrastructure. This instant architecture demonstrates how to quickly develop and test IoT applications in the cloud for seamless deployment to the edge.

Nutanix has already created the basic infrastructure you need to get started.

**What’s In the Karbon Services for IoT Trial?**
1. Karbon Services for IoT management console, which provides the base for your Karbon Services for IoT trial.
1. A Starter project that includes:
    * You (the project user).
    * Xi Edge stack, connected and ready to go: no cluster or bare-metal resources required on your part.
    * YouTube-8M application, just waiting for your YouTube-8M video URL.
    * Karbon Services for IoT Sensor smartphone app, if you want to use your own video instead of YouTube-8M.

**What Can I Do with the Karbon Services for IoT Trial?**
* Stream video from YouTube-8M video or your smartphone to the Xi Cloud edge.
* Automatically run containerized apps at the edge to perform object recognition on your video.
* Stream the results back to the Karbon Services for IoT console or your smartphone, with recognized objects highlighted in your video.
